# CodeDoodles

Welcome to **CodeDoodles** â€” my personal playground for messing around with code.  
Here you'll find little experiments, practice projects, lab assignments, and random coding doodles.

## What's Inside
- `Lab2_DigitalWallet/` â€“ Digital Wallet in Java
- `Lab3_Calculator/` â€“ Calculator project
- `MiniProjects/` â€“ Small fun projects
- `Algorithms/` â€“ Data structure & algorithm practice

Feel free to browse, play around, or just get inspired.  
Most projects are in Java and ready to open in any Java IDE.  

Happy doodling! ðŸš€
